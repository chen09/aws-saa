Raid 5 and 6 are not recommended because of the extended stripe. If you encounter this question on the exam I suspect the answer options will be different. Raid 1 Disadvantage Does not provide a write performance improvement; requires more Amazon EC2 to Amazon EBS bandwidth than non-RAID configurations because the data is written to multiple volumes simultaneously. Raid 0 Disadvantage Performance of the stripe is limited to the worst performing volume in the set. Loss of a single volume results in a complete data loss for the array. Raid 5 and 6 notes RAID 5 and RAID 6 are not recommended for Amazon EBS because the parity write operations of these RAID modes consume some of the IOPS available to your volumes. Depending on the configuration of your RAID array, these RAID modes provide 20-30% fewer usable IOPS than a RAID 0 configuration. Increased cost is a factor with these RAID modes as well; when using identical volume sizes and speeds, a 2-volume RAID 0 array can outperform a 4-volume RAID 6 array that costs twice as much."

(Even though AWS will automatically recover the failed node, there are no other nodes in the cluster) http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/UserGuide/BestPractices.html Mitigating Node Failures To mitigate the impact of a node failure, spread your cached data over more nodes. Because Memcached does not support replication, a node failure will always result in some data loss from your cluster. When you create your Memcached cluster you can create it with 1 to 20 nodes, or more by special request. Partitioning your data across a greater number of nodes means you’ll lose less data if a node fails. For example, if you partition your data across 10 nodes, any single node stores approximately 10% of your cached data. In this case, a node failure loses approximately 10% of your cache which needs to be replaced when a replacement node is created and provisioned.

If you are running EMR in production you should specify an AMI version, Hive version, Pig version, etc. to make sure the version does not change unexpectedly (e.g. when EMR later adds support for a newer version). If your cluster is mission critical, only use Spot instances for task nodes because if the Spot price increases you may lose the instances. In development, use logging and enable debugging to spot and correct errors faster. If you are using GZIP, keep your file size to 1–2 GB because GZIP files cannot be split.

The requirements are that you will have a lot of EC2 instances but may need to add more when the average utilization of your Amazon EC2 fleet is high and conversely remove them when CPU utilization is low. Which AWS services would be best to use to accomplish this?," Auto Scaling, Amazon CloudWatch and AWS Elastic Beanstalk "," Auto Scaling, Amazon CloudWatch and Elastic Load Balancing. "," Amazon CloudFront, Amazon CloudWatch and Elastic Load Balancing. "," AWS Elastic Beanstalk , Amazon CloudWatch and Elastic Load Balancing.",,,,,,,B,,"Auto Scaling enables you to follow the demand curve for your applications closely, reducing the need to manually provision Amazon EC2 capacity in advance. For example, you can set a condition to add new Amazon EC2 instances in increments to the Auto Scaling group when the average utilization of your Amazon EC2 fleet is high; and similarly, you can set a condition to remove instances in the same increments when CPU utilization is low. If you have predictable load changes, you can set a schedule through Auto Scaling to plan your scaling activities. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to send alarms to trigger scaling activities and Elastic Load Balancing to help distribute traffic to your instances within Auto Scaling groups. Auto Scaling enables you to run your Amazon EC2 fleet at optimal utilization. Reference: http://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/"
463,You are building infrastructure for a data warehousing solution and an extra request has come through that there will be a lot of business reporting queries running all the time and you are not sure if your current DB instance will be able to handle it. What would be the best solution for this?, DB Parameter Groups , Read Replicas , Multi-AZ DB Instance deployment , Database Snapshots,,,,,,,B,,"Read Replicas make it easy to take advantage of MySQL's built-in replication functionality to elastically scale out beyond the capacity constraints of a single DB Instance for read-heavy database workloads. There are a variety of scenarios where deploying one or more Read Replicas for a given source DB Instance may make sense. Common reasons for deploying a Read Replica include: Scaling beyond the compute or I/O capacity of a single DB Instance for read-heavy database workloads. This excess read traffic can be directed to one or more Read Replicas. Serving read traffic while the source DB Instance is unavailable. If your source DB Instance cannot take I/O requests (e.g. due to I/O suspension for backups or scheduled maintenance), you can direct read traffic to your Read Replica(s). For this use case, keep in mind that the data on the Read Replica may be ""stale"" since the source DB Instance is unavailable. Business reporting or data warehousing scenarios; you may want business reporting queries to run against a Read Replica, rather than your primary, production DB Instance.

A vault inventory refers to the list of archives in a vault. For each archive in the list, the inventory provides archive information such as archive ID, creation date, and size. Amazon Glacier updates the vault inventory approximately once a day, starting on the day the first archive is uploaded to the vault. A vault inventory must exist for you to be able to download it. Downloading a vault inventory is an asynchronous operation. You must first initiate a job to download the inventory. After receiving the job request, Amazon Glacier prepares your inventory for download. After the job completes, you can download the inventory data. Given the asynchronous nature of the job, you can use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notifications to notify you when the job completes. You can specify an Amazon SNS topic for each individual job request or configure your vault to send a notification when specific vault events occur. Amazon Glacier prepares an inventory for each vault periodically, every 24 hours. If there have been no archive additions or deletions to the vault since the last inventory, the inventory date is not updated. When you initiate a job for a vault inventory, Amazon Glacier returns the last inventory it generated, which is a point-in-time snapshot and not real-time data.

You have two options depending on how you choose to manage the encryption keys: Server-side encryption and client-side encryption. Server-side encryption is about data encryption at rest--that is, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it for you when you access it. As long as you authenticate your request and you have access permissions, there is no difference in the way you access encrypted or unencrypted objects. Amazon S3 manages encryption and decryption for you. For example, if you share your objects using a pre- signed URL, that URL works the same way for both encrypted and unencrypted objects.

It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity, while managing time- consuming database administration tasks, freeing you up to focus on your applications and business. When you create or modify your DB Instance to run as a Multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically provisions and maintains a synchronous ""standby"" replica in a different Availability Zone. Updates to your DB Instance are synchronously replicated across Availability Zones to the standby in order to keep both in sync and protect your latest database updates against DB Instance failure. During certain types of planned maintenance, or in the unlikely event of DB Instance failure or Availability Zone failure, Amazon RDS will automatically failover to the standby so that you can resume database writes and reads as soon as the standby is promoted. Since the name record for your DB Instance remains the same, you application can resume database operation without the need for manual administrative intervention. With Multi-AZ deployments, replication is transparent: you do not interact directly with the standby, and it cannot be used to serve read traffic. If you are using Amazon RDS for MySQL and are looking to scale read traffic beyond the capacity constraints of a single DB Instance, you can deploy one or more Read Replicas.

In general, when your object size reaches 100 MB, you should consider using multipart uploads instead of uploading the object in a single operation. Using multipart upload provides the following advantages: Improved throughput--You can upload parts in parallel to improve throughput. Quick recovery from any network issues--Smaller part size minimizes the impact of restarting a failed upload due to a network error. Pause and resume object uploads--You can upload object parts over time. Once you initiate a multipart upload there is no expiry; you must explicitly complete or abort the multipart upload.

", Every Amazon SES sender has a the same set of sending limits , Sending limits are based on messages rather than on recipients , Every Amazon SES sender has a unique set of sending limits,,,,,,,D,,"Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) is a highly scalable and cost-effective email-sending service for businesses and developers. Amazon SES eliminates the complexity and expense of building an in-house email solution or licensing, installing, and operating a third-party email service for this type of email communication. Every Amazon SES sender has a unique set of sending limits, which are calculated by Amazon SES on an ongoing basis: Sending quota -- the maximum number of emails you can send in a 24-hour period. Maximum send rate -- the maximum number of emails you can send per second. New Amazon SES users who have received production access can send up to 10,000 emails per 24-hour period, at a maximum rate of 5 emails per second. Amazon SES automatically adjusts these limits upward, as long as you send high-quality email. If your existing quota is not adequate for your needs and the system has not automatically increased your quota, you can submit an SES Sending Quota Increase case at any time. Sending limits are based on recipients rather than on messages. You can check your sending limits at any time by using the Amazon SES console. Note that if your email is detected to be of poor or questionable quality (e.g., high complaint rates, high bounce rates, spam, or abusive content), Amazon SES might temporarily or permanently reduce your permitted send volume, or take other action as AWS deems appropriate.

You can use the BitTorrent protocol to retrieve any publicly-accessible object in Amazon S3. Amazon S3 supports the BitTorrent protocol so that developers can save costs when distributing content at high scale. Amazon S3 is useful for simple, reliable storage of any data. The default distribution mechanism for Amazon S3 data is via client/server download. In client/server distribution, the entire object is transferred point-to- point from Amazon S3 to every authorized user who requests that object. While client/server delivery is appropriate for a wide variety of use cases, it is not optimal for everybody. Specifically, the costs of client/server distribution increase linearly as the number of users downloading objects increases. This can make it expensive to distribute popular objects. BitTorrent addresses this problem by recruiting the very clients that are downloading the object as distributors themselves: Each client downloads some pieces of the object from Amazon S3 and some from other clients, while simultaneously uploading pieces of the same object to other interested ""peers."" The benefit for publishers is that for large, popular files the amount of data actually supplied by Amazon S3 can be substantially lower than what it would have been serving the same clients via client/server download. Less data transferred means lower costs for the publisher of the object. Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3Torrent.html"
